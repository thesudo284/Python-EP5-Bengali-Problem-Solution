What We'll Do:

Store the Numbers: We'll give Python the numbers 34 and 78 and remember them.
Do the Math: We'll tell Python to add, subtract, multiply, divide, square, and cube those numbers.
Show the Answers: Python will show us the results.
Here's the Python Code:

Python

# First, let's store our numbers
number1 = 34
number2 = 78

# Now, let's do the math and show the answers!

# Addition
addition_result = number1 + number2
print("Addition:", addition_result)

# Subtraction
subtraction_result = number1 - number2
print("Subtraction:", subtraction_result)

# Multiplication
multiplication_result = number1 * number2
print("Multiplication:", multiplication_result)

# Division
division_result = number1 / number2
print("Division:", division_result)

# Square of the first number
square_number1 = number1 ** 2
print("Square of", number1, ":", square_number1)

# Square of the second number
square_number2 = number2 ** 2
print("Square of", number2, ":", square_number2)

# Cube of the first number
cube_number1 = number1 ** 3
print("Cube of", number1, ":", cube_number1)

# Cube of the second number
cube_number2 = number2 ** 3
print("Cube of", number2, ":", cube_number2)
Let's break it down:

number1 = 34 and number2 = 78: This is like writing the numbers on a piece of paper and labeling them "number1" and "number2" so we can remember them.
+, -, *, /: These are the math symbols you already know: plus, minus, times, and divided by.
**: This symbol is special to Python. When you write number1 ** 2, it means "number1 squared" (number1 times itself). And number1 ** 3 means "number1 cubed" (number1 times itself, times itself again).
print(): This is how we tell Python to show us the answers. It's like writing the results on the screen.
print("Addition:", addition_result): The part in quotes ("Addition:") is just a label to tell us what the number means. The rest is the answer.
How to Run the Code:

Open a Python environment: You can use an online Python editor (like repl.it or trinket.io) or install Python on your computer.
Copy and paste the code: Put the code into the Python editor.
Run the code: Click the "run" button.
You'll see the answers pop up on the screen!
